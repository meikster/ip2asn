ip2asn

gives the AS number associated with an IP address.

Works with ipv4 and ipv6

== Apologies ==
This code is *very* crappy. Initially there were 2 distincts programs for
ipv4 and ipv6, but I wanted to merge them into a single program. It required
a bit of re-factoring, but I am too lazy to do it right now.

You will find a lot of redundant code. Parsing isn't very efficient too.
Actually this code was never meant to be scalable, nor published.

I started this as a personal project a few years ago...

== Requirements ==
- libgmp (ipv6 to integer stuff)
- libbsd (fgetln function)

Requirements should be met under Ubuntu-like distros like this:
# apt-get install libbsd libbsd-dev libgmp10 libgmp10-dev
(or something like that).

== Compilation ==
just type "make"
$ make
gcc -Wall -Werror -W -ansi -pedantic   -c -o ip2asn.o ip2asn.c
gcc -o ip2asn ip2asn.o -lbsd -lgmp
(perfect compile on Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS)

== Initialization ==
Since this code is using Maxmind databases (yeah, maybe I could have used
their API or a higher level programming language), and I can't distribute
their DB or so, I just provide a sample script which retrieves one of the
databases (ipv4) and unzips it.

== Basic usage ==
$ ./ip2asn 8.8.8.8
[+] 8.8.8.8 belongs to "AS15169 Google Inc."

$ ./ip2asn 2a00:1450:400b:c02::65
[+] 2a00:1450:400b:c02::65 belongs to "AS15169 Google Inc."


== Limitations / bugs ==
A lot.

Since this code is a patchwork of two differents programs I made, a lot of
dirty things are hidden. Someday I will fix these things.

== TODO ==

- batch processing
- in memory storage of data structures (for batch processing it will be faster...)
- ...
